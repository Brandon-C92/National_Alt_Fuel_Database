# Exploring A National Database of Available Alternative Fuel Stations and Locations of the United States of America
# SPC Brandon Cooke, USARMY
A interactive map with current Alternative fuel stations with locations on an interacive Folium map that can be localized or drag-and-dropped into a web browser along with data analytics of the types of fuel stations throughout the US.

About the Open Energy Data Initiative (OEDI)
OEDI is a centralized repository of high-value energy research datasets aggregated from the U.S. Department of Energyâ€™s Programs, Offices, and National Laboratories. Built to enable data discoverability, OEDI facilitates access to a broad network of findings, including the data available in technology-specific catalogs like the Geothermal Data Repository and Marine Hydrokinetic Data Repository.

OEDI is powered by OpenEI, an energy information portal sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy and developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in support of the Open Government Initiative to make energy data transparent, participatory, and collaborative.
# Data Description

Alternative fueling stations are located throughout the United States and Canada, and their availability continues to grow. The Alternative Fuels Data Center (AFDC) maintains a website where you can find alternative fueling stations near you or on a route, obtain counts of alternative fueling stations by state, view maps, and more.

The most recent dataset available for download here provides a "snapshot" of the alternative fueling station information for compressed natural gas (CNG), ethanol (E85), propane/liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), biodiesel (B20 and above), electric vehicle charging, hydrogen, and liquefied natural gas (LNG), as of July 29, 2021.

#Capstone 1 Goals
- Visualize interacive map displaying Fueling Locations all around the US.
- Find out what the most common types of alternative fuels available at these stations are.
- Find out if certain types of alternative fuels more prevalent in specific cities or areas.
- and expand my general knowlege of Python
